All-remote work promotes:
> 1. Hiring and working from all over the world instead of from a central location.
> 2. Flexible working hours over set working hours.
> 3. Writing down and recording knowledge over verbal explanations.
> 4. Written down processes over on-the-job training.
> 5. Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
> 6. Opening up every document for editing by anyone over top-down control of documents.
> 7. Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.
> 8. The results of work over the hours put in.
> 9. Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.
