1. **Self host.** We will ask you to spin up and host your app for 1 week.

## How You Will Be Evaluated
* Our exam is designed to be an accurate reflection of the type of work you will be doing at our fast growing, lean startup. 
* Your Engineer Level (E0-10) and therefore salary package will be decided by the completeness of your web app and the quality of your work. 
	* The more functional features you are able to complete on our checklist, the higher your engineering/salary level.

### We value:
1. **Speed.** How quickly can you build a working app with a list of features?
1. **Code Quality.** How easy is it for other engineers to maintain your app?

### We will evaluate:
1. Your live web app with features as described by the exam, hosted on your own computer.
	1. **Functional and working.** We value functional, working prototypes, so make sure your site is live and running before you move onto additional features. Before your exam date to save time, we recommend setting a blank single page site on your development machine accessible on the web.
	1. **Quality over quantity.** We would rather you focus on fewer features that are working and bug-free, rather than a bunch of broken, buggy features.
1. Your code, hosted on Github. (This can serve as a portfolio for your future interviews and resume.)
