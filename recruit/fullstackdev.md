## Exam Description
1. You will build and launch 1 fully functional web app (RWD) in **2 hours**
1. You choose the programming language and framework. (Choose language and framework you are the most familiar and proficient in. However, we use JS, Express, Node, and React Redux at AVL)
1. We will ask you to spin up and host your app for 1 week.

## How You Will Be Evaluated
* Our exam is designed to be an accurate reflection of the type of work you will be doing at our fast growing, lean startup. 
* Your Engineer Level (E0-10) and therefore salary package will be decided by the completeness of your web app and the quality of your work. The more functional features you are able to complete on our checklist, the higher your engineering/salary level.

### We value:
1. **Speed.** How quickly can you build a working app with a list of features?
1. **Code Quality.** How easy is it for other engineers to maintain your app?

### We will evaluate:
1. Your live web app with features as described by the exam, hosted on your own computer.
  1. We value functional, working prototypes, so make sure your site is live and running before you move onto additional features. Before your exam date to save time, we recommend setting a blank single page site on your development machine accessible on the web.
  1. We would rather you focus on fewer features that are working and bug-free, rather than a bunch of broken, buggy features.
1. Your code, hosted on Github. (This can serve as a portfolio for your future interviews and resume.)

## Pre-Exam Preparation
1. **Development Environment.** Setup a linux-based development environment. We recommend MacOS or Ubuntu.
	1. Setup JavaScript, Python, or any language you wish to use.
	1. Setup any web framework youâ€™re most familiar with (e.g. Django, React.js, Node.js)
	1. Setup IDEs or any developer tools to maximize your efficiency during the exam.
1. **Self-Hosting Test.** Make sure you can host a webpage from you development box on the world wide web.
	1. Open a port that is more secure than commonly scanned ports (e.g. Port 22)
	1. Make sure firewall configured so you can see your web page outside of your local area network.
1. **GitHub Account.** Make sure you have a public GitHub account that you can host your exam submission code for us to evaluate.
