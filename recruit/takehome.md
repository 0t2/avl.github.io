## Why we do take home exams?

我們的考題是模仿我們網頁開發團隊每天實際做的工作。在家線上考試可以客觀、公平、準確的評估工程師的實踐能力，讓參考者節省時間、彈性安排時段、最佳表現實際網站開發能力。2.5小時快速測量職級並決定與薪資.

### 1. Stop wasting time practicing LeetCode
* You won't need to spend time practicing, preparing, or studying for our interview process.
* Real developers will never have to implement binary search or bubble sort, so we don't waste your time on irrelevant tests for the sake of testing.

### 2. Exams reflect actual, real work
* We design our exams to be as close to the work you will be doing as much as possible.
* You will have access to your own dev environment, online resources, just like in real work.

### 3. Time limited to 2.5 hours
* Never ending interview processes are disrespectful to the candidates.
* We limit how much of your time we take up to make a technical decision to 2.5 hours.
* This is the only technical evaluation.

### 4. Creative room
* Because take home exams have large degree of open-endedness, this leaves a lot of room for candidates to show their creative side.

### 5. Flexible scheduling
* Do the take home exam at your convenience.

### 6. Learning something along the way
* You will likely learn something you didn't know before.
* We want hungry people who love coding and learning new things.

### 7. Build up your own open source portfolio
* Publish your exam on github and build up your github presence.
