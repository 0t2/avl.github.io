## Why we do take home exams?

### 1. Exams reflect actual, real work
* Stop wasting time practicing on LeetCode.
* You won't need to spend time practicing, preparing, or studying for our interview process.
* Real developers will never have to implement binary search or bubble sort, so we don't waste your time on irrelevant tests for the sake of testing.
* We design our exams to be as close to the work you will be doing as much as possible.
* You will have access to your own dev environment, online resources, just like in real work.

### 2. Time limited to 2 hours
* Never ending interview processes are disrespectful to the candidates.
* We limit how much of your time we take up to make a technical decision to 2 hours.
* This is the only technical evaluation.

### 3. Creative room
* Because take home exams have large degree of open-endedness, this leaves a lot of room for candidates to show their creative side.

### 4. Flexible scheduling
* Do the take home exam at your convenience.

### 5. Learning something along the way
* You will likely learn something you didn't know before.
* We want hungry people who love coding and learning new things.

### 6. Build up your own open source portfolio
* Publish your exam on github and build up your github presence.
