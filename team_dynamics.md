## Team Dynamics Expectations

### 1. Effective communication is key
* Communicate clearly and directly
* This includes checking-in frequently, and informing team members about important  meetings/events/progress  
* When asked a question, answer first (Yes or No); then provide detailed explanation
* Unscheduled/unplanned status updates (i.e., while grabbing coffee): give one or two  lines about what matters most to the company
* Text, Slack, or call when following up on an high-priority issue 

### 2. Pressure Test
* Proactively ask hard questions in a team setting

### 3. Be prepared for ad hoc informal syncs 
* The team often has impromptu informal sync-ups across workstreams to ensure everyone is updated

### 4. Delegate, not assign
* When providing direction, ask the responsible person to repeat back what he or she needs to do to ensure there is no misunderstanding 
* Manage deliverables to/from anyone and everyone to a specific deadline 

### 5. Do not become the bottleneck of information
* Communicate effectively and timely to leadership and to your team

### 6. Following up on a request
* Just because you delivered an information doesn’t mean the recipient is fully notified. You have to engage and confirm that they received and understood your message
* Until you have received verbal or written feedback responding to your request, it is your responsibility to persistently follow up until you get an answer

### 7. Phone calls 
* Never decline a call from your mother (the woman who gave birth to you) or grandmother (the woman who spoils you the most) in a team meeting, but do tell them you are busy and will call them back; no one else is granted this exception

### 8. Aggressively integrate yourself into the team and other new joiners
