## Why is there such a large salary range?

We believe individuals should be rewarded fairly and transparently for their performance. 

### This is What Candidates Want

In a survey, we asked over 100 candidates about their ideal company.

We asked:

> **Bonus distrubtion: 獎勵制度**

> (1) 內部薪水年終獎金差距大，依照每人的工作成績

> (2) 內部薪水年終獎金差距小，即使大家對共識貢獻有差距

### Less Motivation in Communist Systems

The truth is, not all individual performances are the same. Between a **communist** system where everyone is paid roughly the same, verus a more **capitalistic** system where there is a wide spread between top and bottom performances, we believe in the capitalistic system. In our experience, there is less motivation to work hard if salaries were all roughly the same.

### Attracting the Right Talent

We wish to attract talent who believe performance should be rewarded 

1. **Proportionally**, and 
2. **Materially different** from peers with a different performance.
