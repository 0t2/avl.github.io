## Why are salaries so transparent?

#### 1. Team members will share salary information among themselves soon or later.

It is impossible to keep salary information confidential.

#### 2. How would you feel if someone with equal or less contribution was paid more than you?

Things are easier if everything was completely transparent from day 1.

## Why is there such a large salary range?

We believe individuals should be rewarded fairly and transparently for their performance. 

### Candidates Tell Us Want a Large Salary Range

In a survey, we asked over 100 candidates about their ideal company. 

[View Survey]({{ site.job_form_url }}){: .btn#page-btn}{:target="_blank"}


We asked:

> **Bonus distrubtion: 獎勵制度**

> (1) 內部薪水年終獎金差距大，依照每人的工作成績 (86%)

> (2) 內部薪水年終獎金差距小，即使大家對共識貢獻有差距 (14%)

The results were **overwhelmingly** in favor of a wide salary range.

### Less Motivation in Communist Systems

The truth is, not all individual performances are the same. Between a

- **Communist System** where everyone is paid roughly the same, verus a 
- **Capitalist System** where there is a wide spread between top and bottom performances

We believe in the capitalistic system. In our experience, there is less motivation to work hard if salaries were all roughly the same.

### Attracting the Right Talent

We wish to attract talent who believe performance should be rewarded 

1. **Proportional** to their performance, and 
2. **Materially different** from peers with a different performance.

<br>

## How are the upper and lower bounds of these salaries chosen?

#### Lower Bound (E0 - 36W)

This is close to the minimum wage in Taiwan. For someone with zero previous software development experience, and requires substantial training and investment, we do not think this is an unfair starting point. The focus should be on where you are going, and not where you're starting at.

#### Upper Bound (E10 - 300W)

Our CTO salary range is around USD $100K per year, which is equivalent to roughly the starting salary of a fresh college graduate with a CS degree in Silicon Valley.

While this value may seem **astronomical** in Taiwan, it is actually quite modest in the US.
