## Why is there such a large salary range?

We believe individuals should be rewarded fairly and transparently for their performance. 

### Candidates Tell Us Want a Large Salary Range

In a survey, we asked over 100 candidates about their ideal company. 

[View Survey]({{ site.job_form_url }}){: .btn#page-btn}{:target="_blank"}


We asked:

> **Bonus distrubtion: 獎勵制度**

> (1) 內部薪水年終獎金差距大，依照每人的工作成績

> (2) 內部薪水年終獎金差距小，即使大家對共識貢獻有差距

The results were **overwhelmingly** in favor of a wide salary range.

### Less Motivation in Communist Systems

The truth is, not all individual performances are the same. Between a

- **Communist System** where everyone is paid roughly the same, verus a 
- **Capitalist System** where there is a wide spread between top and bottom performances

We believe in the capitalistic system. In our experience, there is less motivation to work hard if salaries were all roughly the same.

### Attracting the Right Talent

We wish to attract talent who believe performance should be rewarded 

1. **Proportional** to their performance, and 
2. **Materially different** from peers with a different performance.
