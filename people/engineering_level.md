## Why is there such a large salary range?

We believe individuals should be rewarded fairly and transparently for their performance. The truth is, not all individual performances are the same. Between a **communist** system where everyone is paid roughly the same, verus a more **capitalistic** system where there is a wide spread between top and bottom performances, we believe in the capitalistic system.

> **We wish to attract talent who believe performance should be rewarded (1) PROPORTIONALLY, and (2) MATERIALLY DIFFERENT from peers with a different performance.**

> In our experience, there is less motivation to work hard if salaries were all roughly the same.
