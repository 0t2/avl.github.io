> You don't promote based on potential. You don't promote based on favoritism. You don't promote based on a feeling. You promote based on actual performance.

## Software Developer Rubric

#### Technical Skills
> Great programmer – able to write modular, maintainable code.

> Able to communicate clearly on technical topics.

## Rating Levels

> **Far exceeds expectations:** This should be very rare, indicating truly extraordinary performance. Maybe you’re doing what someone two levels above you would be doing. Or you're making an unusually high impact.

> **Exceeds expectations:** This means you’re consistently knocking it out of the park. You’re starting to do the job above you.

> **Achieves expectations:** This is where 50 to 60% of people are expected to land. Achieving expectations means you’re hitting an already very high bar.

> **Does not achieve expectations:** Getting this rating means you're struggling and either need help, plan to improve or both. Your manager and People Ops are responsible for helping you turn this around.
